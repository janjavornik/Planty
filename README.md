## Troubleshooting

### Add-on Issues
**Add-on won't start**: Check the add-on logs for error messages and ensure all required options are configured

**Web UI not accessible**: Verify the add-on is running and check port 8099 is not blocked by firewall

**Plants not syncing to Home Assistant**: Check the Home Assistant API token and ensure the add-on has proper permissions

### Plant Issues
**Humidity sensor not working**: Verify the sensor entity exists in Home Assistant and has device_class: humidity

**Images not displaying**: Check that the image storage path is writable and accessible

**Plant status incorrect**: Verify watering intervals and last watered dates are correct

### Network Issues
**WebSocket connection fails**: Check network connectivity and firewall settings
