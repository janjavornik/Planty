  - 🟠 **Orange**: 80-99% (Watering soon) 
  - 🔴 **Red**: 100%+ (Needs water)
- **Dual Modes**:
  - **Sensor Mode**: Shows humidity percentage
  - **Manual Mode**: Shows days left + water button
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Click card to open settings
  - Water button with custom date picker
  - Real-time updates via Home Assistant state changes

#### **Planty Header Card** (`planty-header-card.js`)
- Beautiful gradient header with plant statistics
- Automatically counts healthy/warning/critical plants
- Responsive design for mobile devices

#### **Planty Settings Card** (`planty-settings-card.js`)
- Add new plants with plant type selection
- Choose from 15+ pre-configured plant types
- Toggle between manual and sensor modes

#### **Planty Welcome Card** (`planty-welcome-card.js`)
- Displays when no plants are configured
- Feature highlights and pro tips
- Direct link to add first plant

### 3. **Enhanced Sensor Logic**
- **File**: `sensor.py`
- **New Attributes**:
  - `progress_percentage`: 0-100% for progress bar
  - `color_state`: "green"/"orange"/"red"
  - `days_since_watered`: Days since last watering
  - `current_humidity`: Live sensor readings
- **Smart Calculations**:
  - Manual mode: Based on watering interval vs. days passed
  - Sensor mode: Based on plant-specific humidity thresholds

### 4. **Advanced Services**
- **File**: `services.yaml`
- **New Services**:
  - `planty.water_plant_custom_date`: Water with specific date
  - `planty.update_plant_settings`: Modify plant configuration
- **Enhanced Services**:
  - Automatic dashboard updates when plants change
  - Real-time entity updates

### 5. **Frontend Integration**
- **File**: `__init__.py` + `manifest.json`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic frontend resource registration
  - Custom card loading via Home Assistant's frontend system
  - Static file serving for card assets

## 🎯 User Experience

### Dashboard Flow
1. **Fresh Install**: Shows welcome card with getting started tips
2. **Add Plants**: Use settings card to add plants with type selection
3. **Plant Cards**: Each plant gets individual card showing:
   - Plant name and type
   - Visual progress bar with color coding
   - Status info (humidity % or days left)
   - Water button (manual mode only)
4. **Settings**: Click any card to configure plant settings

### Plant Status Colors
- **🟢 Green (Optimal)**: Plant is well-watered, progress < 80%
- **🟠 Orange (Watering Soon)**: Approaching water time, progress 80-99%
- **🔴 Red (Needs Water)**: Requires immediate attention, progress ≥ 100%

### Interaction Modes
- **Manual Mode**: 
  - Shows "X days left" 
  - Water button opens date picker
  - Progress based on days since last watering
- **Sensor Mode**:
  - Shows "X.X%" humidity
  - No water button (automated)
  - Progress based on humidity vs. plant thresholds
